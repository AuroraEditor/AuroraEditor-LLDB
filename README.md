# AuroraEditor LLDB

AuroraEditor LLDB is an open-source debugger project inspired and influenced by several notable repositories, including:

1. [apple/llvm-project](https://github.com/apple/llvm-project/tree/next/lldb)
2. [apple/swift-lldb](https://github.com/apple/swift-lldb)
3. [llvm/llvm-project](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/lldb)

Debugging is a complex task, especially when it involves multiple current and future programming languages. The goal of AuroraEditor LLDB is to create a debugger that can seamlessly debug various languages natively in Swift. This approach is aimed at ensuring compatibility with [AuroraEditor](https://github.com/AuroraEditor/AuroraEditor) and providing optimal performance.

While it may not be possible to entirely implement the debugger in Swift due to certain system-level requirements often associated with debuggers, our aim is to replicate the functionality to the best of our abilities within the Swift ecosystem.

## Project Status

There is no fixed timeline for the completion of AuroraEditor LLDB. Building debuggers is a challenging endeavor, much like developing an editor. However, we have a strong foundation and valuable references thanks to the contributions and insights from Apple and the LLVM community.

We invite developers and contributors to join us on this journey to create a powerful, Swift-native debugger that enhances the debugging experience for various programming languages. Your contributions and support are greatly appreciated as we work towards making AuroraEditor LLDB a robust and versatile debugging tool.
